### Abstract

This challenge was completed YearOne. The challenge was to build a small web application that allows a user to search for a movie title, click on that movie title for more information, and give that movie a thumbs up or thumbs down. The challenge instructions allowed me to use and API of my choice for the search and displaying the movies information. For giving a rating of the selected movie, I had to make an API to save implement some type of storage or database to persist movie titles and how many thumbs up or thumbs down theyâ€™ve received.
